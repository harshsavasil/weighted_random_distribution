# weighted_random_distribution
Weighted Random number generation.
The script can be used to generate random numbers between a given range a and b. 
BY Default elemnets in lower half of range have lower probability, by default it is 27%, for equal distribution just set probability of both upper and lower half equal to 50. 
## Run python weighted_random_distribution.py --help to seek help about the parameters.
List of Parameters - <br/>
--start - start of range. Default value is 1 and type is integer. <br/>
--end - end of range. Default values is 10 and type is integer. <br/>
--total - total number of random numbers you want to generate. <br/>
--lower - probability of elements of lower half. <br/>
--upper - probability of elements of upper half. <br/>
